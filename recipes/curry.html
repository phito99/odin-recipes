    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Japanese curry is a delicious dish that is very simple to make. With a few ingredients and about 30 minutes, you can make a dish that will feed you for days.
        Japanese curry is very hearty and in my opinion, the spicier you opt for the better. Below I will outline the ingredients needed, as well as the steps to 
        make the curry for yourself.
